## Solution details

_Here, explain how the challenge went. Some examples of what we'd like to read here:_
 
- _What did you wanted to do at first?_
 create a system where anyone can log into any identity (user) Thus creating a dialog where the user name refers to a shared identity and not an individual
- _What did you end up doing?_
 building the prototype of the system where the user can log in as any account
- _How did it go, overall? Do you think you have succeeded?_
 The message sending was not implemented and user account needs to be affiliated with message
- _Is there anything that **blocked** you?_
 Issues with understanding the server and proprietary code
- _Is there anything that you are **proud of**?_
 bypassing the password verification

_A couple of lines should be enough, just make sure we have a clear idea of what you did, so we can rate your **whole participation** and not just your **final result**._
